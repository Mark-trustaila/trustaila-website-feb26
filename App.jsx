      help: "A DSAR does not need to mention 'subject access request', 'GDPR', or 'Article 15'. Staff must recognise informal requests like 'can you tell me what information you hold on me?' as valid DSARs. The ICO has reprimanded organisations where front-line staff failed to identify requests.",

      help: "In December 2024 the ICO reprimanded an NHS Trust for failing to respond to 32% of DSARs on time, citing inadequate logging systems as a root cause. A SAR log should record: date received, deadline, current status, who is handling it, what was disclosed, and any exemptions applied.",

      help: "The ICO permits organisations to offer a standard form to help requesters specify what they want, but you cannot insist on its use. A request is valid regardless of format. Making a form available can help manage requests efficiently, but refusing requests that do not use the form is non-compliant.",

      help: "The one-month clock starts on the day of receipt, not when the request is logged or acknowledged. The ICO's enforcement actions consistently cite missed deadlines as a primary failure — Southampton NHS Trust responded to only 59% on time, Lewisham Council managed just 35%.",

      help: "Under the DUA Act 2025 changes, the time limit for responding is now explicitly paused while you wait for the data subject to clarify their request. This is a significant change — previously the position was less clear. You should document when clarification was sought and when the response was received.",

Common ones include: legal professional privilege, management forecasts, records of intentions in negotiations, and confidential references given by your organisation.
